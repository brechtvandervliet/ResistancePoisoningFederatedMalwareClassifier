* Running LiM
- The code lives in lim_code.
- Configure the dataset to be used in lim_code/generate_dataset.conf
  - The section *dataset* is the one the scripts will use.
  - Make sure there is only one dataset section.
- The runnable scripts are in the _lim_code/run_ directory.
  - I run them with src_python[:exports code]{venv/bin/python -m run.module}
  - For instance, src_python[:exports code]{venv/bin/python -m run.run_adversarial_federation}
- run_federation assumes extract_features has been run, and that the output files are in dataset/prepared/
  - For instance, I would move the generated mamadroid files with this command:
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports code
     mv app_names.pickle  feature_lists.pickle  feature_names.pickle  features.npz  labels.npz dataset_mamadroid/prepared/
     #+END_SRC
